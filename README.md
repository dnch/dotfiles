# Hey, More Dotfiles!

I may have named this repo incorrectly, as if it works the way I intend it to, the only hidden file needed will be `.config` :tada:

## Getting Started

Everything here is based around `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` being present, including for `fish`. Given that (so far) the only target platform for these dotfiles is macOS, I'm using `launchctl` to have it present for every process launched.
